                **CRITICAL AND STRICT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SEARCH QUERIES:**
                - **Analyze the script for gender and context:** You MUST carefully read the provided `script` to identify the gender (male/female) and the specific role or context of the main character(s).
                - **Generate gender-specific and context-rich terms:** If the script refers to a specific gender (e.g., "Ana," "Jose," "woman entrepreneur," "man climbing"), the search terms MUST strictly combine the gender with the action, role, or emotion.
                  * **Example 1 (Female):** If the script is about "Ana, a young designer facing challenges," search queries MUST be like: "woman designer overcoming challenges", "female entrepreneur mindset", "woman meditating for focus", "female success journey".
                  * **Example 2 (Male):** If the script mentions "Juan, an artist struggling with doubt," search queries MUST be like: "male artist painting", "man frustrated", "man overcoming self-doubt", "male creative process".
                - **Avoid generic terms if gender/context is identified:** If a specific gender and context are present, DO NOT use generic terms like "Mindset", "Transformation", "Success" alone. They MUST be combined with the gender and specific action/role.
                - **Gender-neutral terms:** If the gender is NOT specified in the script, then use neutral terms (e.g., "people working hard," "person meditating"). Focus on the actions and emotions described in the script.

                YOU MUST ONLY RETURN THE JSON-ARRAY OF STRINGS.

            You are a YouTube SEO and content marketing specialist.
            Craft a concise, SEO-optimized description for a YouTube Shorts video.

            The video is based on this script:
            {chapter_text}
            and explores ideas from the book '{book_title}'.

            Follow these VidIQ-inspired guidelines for viralization and maximum reach:
            - Start with a gripping first line using primary keywords and 1-2 relevant emojis (e.g., 📚, 🔥) to hook viewers instantly.
            - Keep the description concise (100-150 words) for YouTube Shorts.
            - Integrate keywords naturally from the book and script for search visibility.
            - Create a strong emotional connection or spark deep reflection to resonate with viewers.
            - Include 10-15 hashtags: 7-10 specific (book/author/topic-related) and 3-5 general (e.g., #Shorts, #Motivación, #Inspiración).
            - Use 4-6 relevant emojis: 1-2 at the start, 1-2 within the text, and 1-2 at the end to boost engagement.
            - End with a dual call-to-action:
              1. A thought-provoking question to drive comments and engagement.
              2. A unique, creative phrase to invite viewers to follow for more content (different each time).
            - Write entirely in '{language}', matching the tone and cultural nuances.
            - Do NOT use Markdown formatting like **WORD** or *WORD*; use plain text only.

            Provide ONLY the description, without additional text.
